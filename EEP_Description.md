# Summer 2023 EEP - Josh McKettrick
## Summary
For my Experiential Exploration Program (EEP), I have chosen the [Emerging Professional EEP](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/careereducation/get-experience/co-op/full-time/options.html). This stragey is designed to build professional and/or technical skills to then be applied to project-based work. I am currently working through courses in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, and many more. All completed course work can be viewed through a link on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/mckettja).

## Application Description
For my personal project, I have decided to create a React.js social media application. My application will include a login splash page, that ultimately leads to a stylized home page with constant data displayed and formatted appropriately. This project is designed to test my skills in React, CSS, HTML, and JSX
